Um and this guy who was drunk or high or both came up to me and he asked me if I knew what day it was so I obviously said no I don't and he said it's my birthday today and I was like ok well happy birthday. And then he asked me for a kiss and then I was like umm no thank you it's fine. And then he said um like cmon it's my birthday and I was like no it's really okay and my friends started to intervene and then um he like walked away really dissapointed and started shouting like I evene asked like um I asked 8 girls and I even asked a dude and no one will give me a kiss and then um so that was weird and we like walked away, whatever and then the next day I was walking through the park and the same guy saw me and he remembered me and shouted \"I still want that kiss\" so then I obviously ran away and that's my ridiculous freshman year story.",
              "I'm a freshman...um basic freshman seminar and I chose utopias and apocalypses because I thought that was going to be really interesting. Umm And we have to read so many books. Like we have to read a book every single week. But the class actually ended up being really not interesting. The only saving grace is that my best friend is in it. So we kind of sit there and we like look at each other awkwardly and... But now I have to read this by Monday. Yea, and I have like procrastinated because I'm a terrible student and I had a chemistry exam this week so...it's really... and I didn't have time to read it. And now I'm reading it and I'm on page 7 of 298. Hopefully I can read it by Monday.",
              "I worked in mutual funds for most of my life, but I'm in the ministry now. I grew up in The Faith. Then I ended up working on Wall Street. And I actually enjoyed the work a lot. For me it was less about the money and more about the excitement and buzz of going to work everyday. I enjoyed making deals and getting things done. But in the end, I just missed God.",
              "Both my kids will have graduated from college in 4.5 years, and I'm heading to Mexico. I'm not kidding. Social Security goes a long way down there. For $300 a week, I could have a place to stay, a satellite dish, a fishing pole, and some rum.",
              "Well I can tell you a moment of really simple joy. I was squatting down in New Orleans, living off donations, and one day I was able to obtain ice, lemons, and sugar all at the same time. So I had lemonade for the entire day. It was right after Katrina hit. I was twenty years old, in the midst of a righteous political phase, and I didn't really have plans for the summer. So I said: \"Racist shit is happening in New Orleans! I've got to get down there!\"",

You know, I'd always talk to her about my friends and my issues, things like that. I've always been really free to speak my mind.

They don't know how hard it is.",
              "My first memory was when I was three years old. My dad set me up on the dresser, and said: \"Jump to daddy!\" Then he let me fall and said, 'Don't trust anyone.' He was twisted like that. I'm pretty sure that's why I'm a loner.",
